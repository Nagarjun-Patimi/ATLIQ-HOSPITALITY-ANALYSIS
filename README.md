# ATLIQ-HOSPITALITY-ANALYSIS

Problem Statement -
    Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share
and revenue.
    However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

It consists of 3 months booking details of all the atliq hotels.

The data used in this project consists of five Excel files:

    Dim_date: This file contains information about dates, including the day of the week and other relevant date attributes.

    Dim_hotels: Contains details about the hotels owned by Atliq Grands, such as their names and locations.

    Dim_rooms: Provides information about the rooms available in the hotels, including their types and capacities.

    Fact_aggregated_bookings: This file aggregates booking data, including total revenue realized, count of bookings, and average ratings given.

    Fact_bookings: Contains detailed booking information, including booking IDs, booking statuses, and cancellation details.

These datasets were used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and derive actionable insights to assist Atliq Grands in regaining market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.
